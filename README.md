## React unit testing

This repo serves as a base to workshops that aim to compare implementation detail testing and behaviour testing.

To navigate it, check the different branches:

-   `master` is just the base with the components that will be tested
-   `enzyme-tests` contains tests that rely on implementation details
-   `enzyme-tests-broken` contains examples of false negatives and positives (check the commits)
-   `rtl-tests` contains tests written with React Testing Library that prevent false negaives and positives from happening :)
